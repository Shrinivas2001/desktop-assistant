In this lockdown period I used my Python skills and made a Desktop Assistant.
It is same as Google Assistant which we use in our phones.
It works over user's voice commands.
You can control your system with your voice command.

**It can:**

* [X] 
* [X] 
* [X] 
* [X] 
* [X] 
* [X] 
* [X] 

And many more features.
